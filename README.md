# PRD, Live Commerce

## Summary

### Live Commerce

A live commerce application is one that provides a platform for merchants to interact with customers in real-time and demonstrate products in order to increase sales. Live commerce applications integrate live streaming capabilities with an e-commerce storefront, allowing customers to purchase products while watching the live stream. Allowing audience members to comment and ask questions in real-time helps consumers to come to purchasing decisions faster.

### Who Manages Live Auctions?

Live auctions are managed by the merchants conducting the auctions, as well as moderators.

### Why Virtual over In-Person

The pros of online shopping for a merchant include:

- Wider reach: Online stores can be accessed by customers from all over the world, which can help merchants to expand their customer base and increase sales.
- Lower costs: Online stores do not require the same costs associated with physical stores such as rental or property maintenance, utilities, insurance and so on. This can result in lower overhead costs for merchants.
- Greater flexibility: Online stores can be open 24/7, which can allow merchants to reach customers at any time.
- Automation: Many e-commerce platforms come with built-in features such as inventory management, shipping and tax calculation, report generation and so on.
- Data collection: Online merchants have access to a wide range of data about their customers such as purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information, which can help them to target their marketing efforts more effectively.

For a consumer, the pros of online shopping include:

- Convenience: Online shopping allows customers to shop from any location and at any time, without the need to travel to a physical store.
- Variety: Online stores often have a wider selection of products than physical stores, which can make it easier for customers to find what they're looking for.
- Comparison shopping: Online customers can easily compare prices and product information from different retailers, which can make it easier for them to find the best deal.
- Reviews and ratings: Customers can easily read reviews and ratings of products and merchants before making a purchase, which can help to build trust and confidence in the buying process.
- Personalization: Online shopping allows customers to save their preferences and previous purchase history, so they can easily find what they are looking for, this helps to enhance their shopping experience.
- Returns and refunds: Many online retailers have easy return and refund policies, which can provide customers with peace of mind when making a purchase.



Also, when having a brick and mortar store you will still need an online presence, so in many ways it's unavoidable!

## Live Commerce Landscape

The current live commerce landscape is diverse and constantly evolving, with a variety of platforms, tools, and technologies being used to facilitate live commerce experiences.

Social media platforms, such as Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook, have become popular venues for live commerce, with many influencers and brands using live streaming features to engage with customers and sell products. E-commerce platforms, such as Shopify and Amazon, have also begun to integrate live streaming features, allowing merchants to sell products directly through live streams.

Live commerce apps and services have also emerged to provide a more dedicated experience for both the consumers and sellers. Some of these apps and services focus on specific types of products or verticals, such as beauty, fashion, and home goods, while others offer more general live commerce functionality.

Live auction is also a new trend in live commerce which allows customers to bid on products and buy them in real-time. This creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity which can increase the perceived value of products and drive sales.

In a live commerce auction, a product or group of products is presented to customers via a live-streamed video. The auctioneer or host, typically a salesperson or influencer, describes the product and its features, and then opens the floor for bidding. Customers can place bids on the product using their mobile device or computer, and the highest bid at any given time is displayed on the screen.

In addition to these, there are new features and technologies being developed specifically to enhance the live commerce experience. For example, virtual reality and augmented reality are being used to create more immersive live commerce experiences, while chatbots and AI are being used to automate customer interactions and streamline the sales process.

Overall, the live commerce landscape is quite dynamic and continues to evolve as new technologies, platforms, and trends emerge. Live commerce has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce by providing a more engaging and interactive shopping experience for customers, and it will be interesting to see how the industry develops in the coming years.

In 2020, live commerce accounted for 10.6% of China's total online retail market. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming_e-commerce_in_China#Market_size_in_China)

The main platforms in China include Kuaishou, Douyin (TokTok), and Taobao Live.

Live commerce auctions are a form of e-commerce that involves live-streaming video and real-time bidding. This allows customers to watch and participate in the auction in real-time, rather than placing bids in advance or at a fixed time.

### Acceptance Criteria

Although all possible features would be ideal, these are the features we should expect from this app, with a quick note about how detailed each one should be.


| Title       | Description | Priority | Notes    |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Find live streams | Users must be able to view live streams of products being sold in real-time. | P0 | The mechanism for showing users all the live streams will be similar to tiktok, using [ACarousel](https://github.com/JWAutumn/ACarousel). |
| Real-time bidding | Users must be able to place bids on products in real-time during live streams. | P0 | Achieved using RTM, having users see the latest price and the next available bidding price. |
| Payment processing | Users must be able to securely make payments for their orders within the app, using a variety of payment methods such as credit card, debit card, and mobile wallet. | P0 | These details will be completed through Apple Pay. |
| Product details | Users must be able to view more detailed information about each product, including images, descriptions, and pricing. | P0 | Limited detail will be essential, more information will be available by showing the product as a card while bidding is in progress. |
| Up to date | The app must be compatible with the latest versions of iOS, utilising the latest advancements in iOS, including SwiftUI. | P1 | The app will be built with the intention of using the latest features available. |
| Interactions | Audience members can add chat messages, hearts, and send gifts to the host | P1 | Chat messages and hearts will be conducted through RTM. Hearts and gifts trigger both a confetti effect, as well as a banuba filter for a short time (~10 seconds) |
| Performance | The app must be able to handle high traffic and perform smoothly without any lag. | P1 | The app will have appropriate memory management, which include making sure to turn off video streams once the user is no longer watching them. This will also contribute to the scalability of the application. |
| Order placement and tracking | Users must be able to place orders for products and track the status of their orders within the app. | P1 | This is important for an end product, but in this scenario we will show dummy data, to avoid setting up a backend for this project. |
| Push notifications | Users must be able to receive push notifications for new products, upcoming live streams, and updates on their orders. | P2 | This would be a great feature to add using the builtin tooling. It may be built out in part, but not required to run and test the app. |
| Analytics | The app should have an analytics system to track user engagement, retention, and conversion rate. | P2 | Some video stream data such as number of streamers and watchers are automatically collected by Agora's video SDK. More data will be collected through Firebase. |
| User registration and login | Users must be able to register for an account and log in to the app using their email and password. | P2 | In this scenario we will simply allow any username and password match, to avoid setting up a backend for this project and recording login data. |
